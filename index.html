      Previously a reasearch physicst employed at 
      <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a> 
      pursuing research in heavy ion collisions in collaboration with the 
      <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid</a>
      experiment, I have just begun a new career as a software 
      engineer with <a href="https://cloudant.com/"> Cloudant, 
      an IBM Company</a>
      <br /><br />
      Working with the CMS Collaboration has been a fantastic opportunity
      to combine my interests in computer science, mathematical modeling,
      and the physics of quarks and gluons while traveling the world as 
      part of an international scientific effort.       
      <br /><br />
      <!-- I am interested in opportunities in data science and software 
      engineering, particularly using python or C++. --> You may view my 
      resume <a href="resume.html">here</a>.

    <br /><br />
    Computing has always been a hobby of mine, starting in high school 
    when I spent weekends configuring network services on desktop 
    linux systems while learning C and perl. Since becoming a 
    professional physicist, I have spent several years performing 
    data analysis and stochastic simulations in C++ and python 
    frameworks.
    <br /><br />
    My previous day-to-day responsibilities as a research scientist 
    included developing and maintaining 
    data transfer and monitoring tools for the Vanderiblt Tier-2 
    CMS computing facility which is a part of the 
    <a href="http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt ACCRE facility</a>.

    Over 1.5 Petabytes of collision data from the CMS experiment 
    at the LHC are housed at this facility using the 
    <a href="http://www.lstore.org/">L-Store</a> logisitcal storage 
    framework developed at Vanderbilt.

    From 2009 to 2015, I worked in collaboration with the 
    <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)</a>
    experiment at the world's most powerful particle accelerator, the 
    <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider">
      Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>, to study the properties of 
    nuclear matter at extreme temperatures of over a trillion degrees 
    Kelvin. The CMS experiment is a $500 million international 
    detector system with excellent capabilites to precisely determine the 
    momentum of charged particles created in collisions between 
    protons or heavy nuclei.

    <br />
    By colliding two heavy nuclei at close to the speed of light, 
    a high temperature bulk system can be created for a very short 
    span of time, in which the protons and neutrons that comprise the 
    nuclei are predicted to undergo a phase transition into a new
    state of nuclear matter often called a Quark-Gluon Plasma.
    <br /><br />
    My recent work has focused on the measurement of charged particles
    produced in collisions between a single proton and a heavy nucleus,
    which helps to enhance the understanding of the various effects that 
    modify charged particle production in nucelus-nucleus collisions 
    relative to proton-proton collisions.
